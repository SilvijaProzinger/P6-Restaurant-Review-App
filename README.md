RESTAURANT REVIEW APP V2 - Changed aria-labelledby to aria-label

DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project was to enhance static webpage to a mobile ready Restaurant Review app by adding responsiveness, accessibility features and
a service worker with caching. This app also implements Google Maps and was made with Udacity's starter code on Google Map branch. There are two options for filtering reviews, filter by neighborhood and filter by cuisine. 


HOW TO RUN

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000

3. Navigate the app by clicking on restaurant name or by using filtering options.
